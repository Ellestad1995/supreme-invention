### Supreme-invention contains the following project or help files
- Bottom Sheet

## Bottom Sheet

A Bottom Sheet. Much like iOS Apple Maps application.
Very eazy to implement.
![Bottom Sheet example](http://i.imgur.com/UCybHN5.png)

``` Swift
  //MARK! - Adding the BottomSheet
  self.bottomSheet = BottomSheet(frame: self.view.frame)
        
        
 Â //Add it to the bottom - the bottom sheet calculate the ofset itself
  self.bottomSheet.bottomPoint = self.view.frame.height
        
  //It shouldn't go higher than the statusBar
  self.bottomSheet.topPoint = (UIApplication.shared.statusBarFrame.height)
  //Add it to the view before running setup()
  self.view.addSubview(self.bottomSheet)
  self.bottomSheet.setup()
  
  self.bottomSheet.content = SomeCustomView() //There is a content view where you can add your own content
  self.bottomSheet.isSearchBarAdded = true //Adds a searchbar above the content view
```



## Selective CollectionView

A UICollectionView with animating cells.

Fill the cells with information, let user tap them, and add cells.

Some functions for verification of different types of data.

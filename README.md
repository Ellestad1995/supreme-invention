Just some code to make developing easier. This repo contains several projects I use in my apps. 
You are free to use any of the code in these projects in your own. 

<h1>Selective collection view</h1>
<p>What a weird name...</p>
<p>Well...this is a collection view with two cells. All made programmatically and uses autolayout.</p>
